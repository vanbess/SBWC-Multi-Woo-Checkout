## PLUGIN: Multi WooCoomerce Checkout for WooCommerce

This is a gradual rework/improvement of a plugin created by another user.

The basic idea is to add the ability to create multiple (ITO look and feel) product upsell pages which piggyback off of WooCommerce's standard checkout functionality, allowing admins to set up upsell pages and provide quick checkout to customers.

NOTE: this is a bespoke plugin created for a client, so will likely require mods to work for your use case.
